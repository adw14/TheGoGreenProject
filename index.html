        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>The Green Project aims to address the ongoing worldwide issue of negative environmental impact  Whether it's the seemingly small act of leaving  the water running while brushing your teeth or the larger-scale impact, like flying a jet across the Pacific Ocean; these actions underscore the urgent need for sustainable practices. After thinking about this it resonated with us how a few simple changes in anyone's daily routine can contribute to creating a healthier and more sustainable world.</p>

        <h2>Initiating</h2>
        <p>We kick-started our initiative by observing the student population and identifying achievable yet effective goals. The problem we’re trying to combat is the main environmental issues such as transportation pollution, lack of water conservation, light pollution, and environmental waste management. We’re doing so by making our community aware of how they can help reduce their effect on these issues with our efforts to create a campaign that fits our target audience, which is our peers. We want our campaign to connect with our friends. We know that everyone is different, so a one-size-fits-all approach won't work. Our goal is to make our campaign interesting, easy to relate to, and something everyone can be a part of. We want to get the attention and involvement of everyone in our diverse community. By sharing information in a way that's easy to understand and relevant to our lives, we hope to make everyone feel like they're part of something important. Education is a big part of what we're doing. We're not just throwing facts at people; we want to help everyone truly understand the issues. We're planning different ways to do this, like workshops, presentations, and interactive sessions. The idea is to go beyond just knowing about the problems. </p>

        <h2>Planning and Organizing</h2>
        <p>Our well-structured plan includes clear goals such as formulating informational flyers, distributing them during school hours and giving out candy to students who bring us pieces of trash they find all around campus!</p>

    <section id="execution">
        <h2>Execution</h2>
        <p>Our first step involved observing the student population and deciding on achievable, effective goals. When seeing the excessive amounts of littering occurring not only in the school, in classrooms, hallways, lunch, etc., but also the parking lot and fields surrounding our campus, we decided that would be the first problem to address. </p>
